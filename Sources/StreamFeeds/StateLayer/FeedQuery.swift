/// A query configuration for retrieving and managing feed data from Stream Feeds.
///
/// `FeedQuery` defines the parameters used to fetch activities, followers, following, and members
/// for a specific feed. It supports filtering, pagination, ranking, and real-time updates.
///
/// ## Example Usage
/// ```swift
/// let query = FeedQuery(
///     group: "user",
///     id: "john",
///     activityLimit: 25,
///     watch: true
/// )
/// ```
public struct FeedQuery: Sendable {
    /// Filter criteria for activities in the feed.
    public var activityFilter: ActivitiesFilter?
    
    /// Maximum number of activities to retrieve.
    public var activityLimit: Int?
    
    /// Custom options for activity selection and processing.
    public var activitySelectorOptions: [String: RawJSON]?
    
    /// Additional data to associate with the feed.
    public var data: FeedInput?
    
    /// Additional data used for ranking activities in the feed.
    public var externalRanking: [String: RawJSON]?
    
    /// The unique identifier for the feed.
    public var fid: FeedId
    
    /// Maximum number of followers to retrieve.
    public var followerLimit: Int?
    
    /// Maximum number of following users to retrieve.
    public var followingLimit: Int?
    
    /// Weights for different interests to influence activity ranking.
    public var interestWeights: [String: Float]?
    
    /// Maximum number of feed members to retrieve.
    public var memberLimit: Int?
    
    /// Overwrite the default ranking or aggregation logic for this feed (for example: good for split testing).
    public var view: String?
    
    /// If true, subscribes to web-socket events for this feed.
    public var watch = true
    
    /// Creates a new feed query with the specified group and ID.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - group: The feed group (e.g., "user", "timeline", "notification").
    ///   - id: The unique identifier within the group.
    ///   - activityFilter: Optional filter criteria for activities.
    ///   - activityLimit: Maximum number of activities to retrieve.
    ///   - activitySelectorOptions: Custom options for activity selection.
    ///   - data: Additional data to associate with the feed.
    ///   - externalRanking: Additional data used for ranking activities.
    ///   - followerLimit: Maximum number of followers to retrieve.
    ///   - followingLimit: Maximum number of following users to retrieve.
    ///   - interestWeights: Weights for different interests to influence ranking.
    ///   - memberLimit: Maximum number of feed members to retrieve.
    ///   - view: Custom view for ranking or aggregation logic.
    ///   - watch: Whether to subscribe to real-time updates for this feed.
