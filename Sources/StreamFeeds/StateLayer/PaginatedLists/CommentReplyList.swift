/// A class representing a paginated list of replies for a specific comment.
///
/// This class provides methods to fetch and manage replies to a comment, including
/// pagination support and real-time updates through WebSocket events. It maintains an
/// observable state that automatically updates when reply-related events are received.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// // Create a reply list for a comment
/// let replyList = client.commentReplyList(
///     for: .init(commentId: "comment-123")
/// )
///
/// // Fetch initial replies
/// let replies = try await replyList.get()
///
/// // Load more replies if available
/// if replyList.state.canLoadMore {
///     let moreReplies = try await replyList.queryMoreReplies()
/// }
///
/// // Observe state changes
/// replyList.state.$replies
///     .sink { replies in
///         // Handle reply updates
///     }
///     .store(in: &cancellables)
/// ```
///
/// ## Features
///
/// - **Pagination**: Supports loading replies in pages with configurable limits
/// - **Real-time Updates**: Automatically receives WebSocket events for reply changes
/// - **Threaded Replies**: Supports nested reply structures with depth control
/// - **Reactions**: Tracks reply reactions and updates in real-time
/// - **Observable State**: Provides reactive state management for UI updates
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// This class is thread-safe and conforms to `Sendable`. All state updates are
/// performed on the main actor to ensure UI consistency.
public final class CommentReplyList: Sendable {

    /// Initializes a new CommentReplyList instance.

    ///   - query: The query configuration for fetching replies
    ///   - client: The feeds client instance

    /// An observable object representing the current state of the reply list.
    ///
    /// This property provides access to the current replies, pagination information,
    /// and real-time updates. The state automatically updates when WebSocket events
    /// are received for reply additions, updates, deletions, and reactions.
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// // Observe reply changes
    /// replyList.state.$replies
    ///     .sink { replies in
    ///         // Update UI with new replies
    ///     }
    ///     .store(in: &cancellables)
    ///
    /// // Check if more replies can be loaded
    /// if replyList.state.canLoadMore {
    ///     // Load more replies
    /// }
    /// ```

    // MARK: - Paginating the List of Comments

    ///
    /// This method retrieves the first page of replies based on the query configuration.
    /// The results are automatically stored in the state and can be accessed through
    /// the `state.replies` property.
    ///
    /// - Returns: An array of `CommentData` representing the fetched replies
    /// - Throws: `APIError` if the network request fails or the server returns an error
    ///
    /// ## Example
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// do {
    ///     let replies = try await replyList.get()
    ///     print("Fetched \(replies.count) replies")
    /// } catch {
    ///     print("Failed to fetch replies: \(error)")

    ///
    /// This method fetches additional replies using the pagination information
    /// from the previous request. If no more replies are available, an empty
    /// array is returned.
    ///
    /// - Parameter limit: Optional limit for the number of replies to fetch.
    ///   If not specified, uses the limit from the original query.
    /// - Returns: An array of `CommentData` representing the additional replies.
    ///   Returns an empty array if no more replies are available.
    /// - Throws: An error if the network request fails or the response cannot be parsed.
    ///
    /// ## Example
    ///

    /// // Check if more replies are available
    /// guard replyList.state.canLoadMore else { return }

    /// do {
