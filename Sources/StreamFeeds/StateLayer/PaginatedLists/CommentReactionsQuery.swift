///
/// - **Pagination**: Supports `next` and `previous` cursors for efficient pagination
/// - **Sorting**: Configurable sorting options for reaction ordering
/// - **Filtering**: Supports filtering by reaction type, user ID, and creation date
/// - **Thread Safety**: Conforms to `Sendable` for safe concurrent access
