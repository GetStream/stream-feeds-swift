/// A query for retrieving comments with filtering, sorting, and pagination options.
///
/// Use this struct to configure how comments should be fetched from the Stream Feeds API.
/// You can specify filters to narrow down results, sorting options, and pagination parameters.
///
/// ## Example Usage
/// ```swift
/// // Simple query with basic filter
/// let query = CommentsQuery(
///     filter: CommentsFilter(
///         filterOperator: .equal,
///         field: .objectId,
///         value: "activity-123"
///     ),
///     sort: .best,
///     limit: 20
/// )
/// 
/// // Complex query with multiple filters
/// let complexQuery = CommentsQuery(
///     filter: CommentsFilter(
///         filterOperator: .and,
///         filters: [
///             CommentsFilter(filterOperator: .equal, field: .objectId, value: "activity-123"),
///             CommentsFilter(filterOperator: .greaterThan, field: .score, value: 5.0),
///             CommentsFilter(filterOperator: .equal, field: .status, value: "active")
///         ]
///     ),
///     sort: .top,
///     limit: 50
/// )
/// ```
