/// A class representing a paginated list of comments for a specific activity.
///
/// This class provides methods to fetch and manage comments for an activity, including
/// pagination support and real-time updates through WebSocket events. It maintains an
/// observable state that automatically updates when comment-related events are received.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// // Create a comment list for an activity
/// let commentList = client.activityCommentList(
///     for: .init(objectId: "activity-123", objectType: "activity")
/// )
///
/// // Fetch initial comments
/// let comments = try await commentList.get()
///
/// // Load more comments if available
/// if commentList.state.canLoadMore {
///     let moreComments = try await commentList.queryMoreReplies()
/// }
///
/// // Observe state changes
/// commentList.state.$comments
///     .sink { comments in
///         // Handle comment updates
///     }
///     .store(in: &cancellables)
/// ```
///
/// ## Features
///
/// - **Pagination**: Supports loading comments in pages with configurable limits
/// - **Real-time Updates**: Automatically receives WebSocket events for comment changes
/// - **Threaded Comments**: Supports nested comment replies
/// - **Reactions**: Tracks comment reactions and updates in real-time
/// - **Observable State**: Provides reactive state management for UI updates
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// This class is thread-safe and conforms to `Sendable`. All state updates are
/// performed on the main actor to ensure UI consistency.

    // MARK: - Accessing the State
    
    /// An observable object representing the current state of the comment list.
    ///
    /// This property provides access to the current comments, pagination information,
    /// and real-time updates. The state automatically updates when WebSocket events
    /// are received for comment additions, updates, deletions, and reactions.
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// // Observe comment changes
    /// commentList.state.$comments
    ///     .sink { comments in
    ///         // Update UI with new comments
    ///     }
    ///     .store(in: &cancellables)
    ///
    /// // Check if more comments can be loaded
    /// if commentList.state.canLoadMore {
    ///     // Load more comments
    /// }
    /// ```

    // MARK: - Paginating the List of Comments
    
    /// Fetches the initial set of comments for the activity.
    ///
    /// This method retrieves the first page of comments based on the query configuration.
    /// The results are automatically stored in the state and can be accessed through
    /// the `state.comments` property.
    ///
    /// - Returns: An array of `CommentData` representing the fetched comments
    /// - Throws: `APIError` if the network request fails or the server returns an error
    ///
    /// ## Example
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// do {
    ///     let comments = try await commentList.get()
    ///     print("Fetched \(comments.count) comments")
    /// } catch {
    ///     print("Failed to fetch comments: \(error)")
    /// }

    ///
    /// This method fetches additional comments using the pagination information
    /// from the previous request. If no more comments are available, an empty
    /// array is returned.
    ///
    /// - Parameter limit: Optional limit for the number of comments to fetch.
    ///   If not specified, uses the limit from the original query.
    /// - Returns: An array of `CommentData` representing the additional comments.
    ///   Returns an empty array if no more comments are available.
    /// - Throws: An error if the network request fails or the response cannot be parsed.
    ///
    /// ## Example
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// // Check if more comments are available
    /// guard commentList.state.canLoadMore else { return }
    ///
    /// // Load more comments
    /// do {
