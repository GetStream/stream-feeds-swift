/// An observable state object that manages the current state of a comment reaction list.
///
/// This class provides reactive state management for a collection of comment reactions.
/// It automatically handles real-time updates when reactions are added or removed from the comment,
/// and maintains pagination state for loading additional reactions.
///
/// ## Observable Properties
///
/// The state object publishes changes to its properties, allowing you to observe updates:
///
/// ```swift
/// commentReactionList.state.$reactions
///     .sink { reactions in
///         // Update UI when reactions change
///     }
///     .store(in: &cancellables)
/// ```
///
/// ## Real-time Updates
///
/// The state automatically updates when WebSocket events are received.
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// This class is marked with `@MainActor` and should only be accessed from the main thread.

    ///     .sink { reactions in
