///
/// - **Pagination**: Supports `next` and `prev` cursors for efficient pagination
/// - **Sorting**: Configurable sorting options for configuration ordering
/// - **Filtering**: Advanced filtering conditions for configuration queries
/// - **Thread Safety**: Conforms to `Sendable` for safe concurrent access
