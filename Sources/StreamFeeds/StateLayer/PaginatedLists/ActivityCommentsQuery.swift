/// A query configuration for fetching comments for a specific activity.
///
/// This struct defines the parameters used to fetch comments for an activity,
/// including pagination settings, sorting options, and depth configuration for
/// threaded comments.
///
/// ## Features
///
/// - **Pagination**: Supports `next` and `previous` cursors for efficient pagination
/// - **Sorting**: Configurable sorting options for comment ordering
/// - **Depth Control**: Limits the depth of threaded comment replies
/// - **Reply Limits**: Controls the number of replies to fetch per comment
/// - **Thread Safety**: Conforms to `Sendable` for safe concurrent access

    ///
    /// This parameter controls how many levels of nested replies to include.
    /// For example, a depth of 2 will include comments and their direct replies,
    /// but not replies to replies.
    ///
    /// - `nil`: No depth limit (fetch all levels)
    /// - `1`: Only top-level comments
    /// - `2`: Comments and their direct replies
    /// - `3`: Comments, replies, and replies to replies

    /// This parameter controls the page size for pagination. Larger values
    /// reduce the number of API calls needed but may increase response time.
    ///
    /// - `nil`: Use server default (typically 25)
    /// - `10-50`: Recommended range for most use cases
    /// - `>50`: May impact performance

    ///
    /// This parameter controls how many replies are included for each comment
    /// in the response. It's useful for limiting the size of threaded comments.
