/// A query configuration for fetching replies to a specific comment.
///
/// This struct defines the parameters used to fetch replies to a comment,
/// including pagination settings, sorting options, and depth configuration for
/// nested reply structures.
///
/// ## Features
///
/// - **Pagination**: Supports `next` and `previous` cursors for efficient pagination
/// - **Sorting**: Configurable sorting options for reply ordering
/// - **Depth Control**: Limits the depth of nested reply structures
/// - **Reply Limits**: Controls the number of nested replies to fetch per reply
/// - **Thread Safety**: Conforms to `Sendable` for safe concurrent access

    /// For example, a depth of 2 will include replies and their direct replies,
    /// but not replies to replies to replies.
    ///
    /// - `nil`: No depth limit

    /// - `3`: Replies, replies to replies, and replies to replies to replies
