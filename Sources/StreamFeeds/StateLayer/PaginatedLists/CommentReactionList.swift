/// A class representing a paginated list of reactions for a specific comment.
///
/// This class provides methods to fetch and manage reactions for a comment, including
/// pagination support and real-time updates through WebSocket events. It maintains an
/// observable state that automatically updates when reaction-related events are received.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// // Create a reaction list for a comment
/// let reactionList = client.commentReactionList(
///     for: .init(commentId: "comment-123")
/// )
///
/// // Fetch initial reactions
/// let reactions = try await reactionList.get()
///
/// // Load more reactions if available
/// if reactionList.state.canLoadMore {
///     let moreReactions = try await reactionList.queryMoreReactions()
/// }
///
/// // Observe state changes
/// reactionList.state.$reactions
///     .sink { reactions in
///         // Handle reaction updates
///     }
///     .store(in: &cancellables)
/// ```
///
/// ## Features
///
/// - **Pagination**: Supports loading reactions in pages with configurable limits
/// - **Real-time Updates**: Automatically receives WebSocket events for reaction changes
/// - **Filtering**: Supports filtering by reaction type, user ID, and creation date
/// - **Sorting**: Configurable sorting options for reaction ordering
/// - **Observable State**: Provides reactive state management for UI updates
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// This class is thread-safe and conforms to `Sendable`. All state updates are
/// performed on the main actor to ensure UI consistency.

    // MARK: - Accessing the State
    
    /// An observable object representing the current state of the comment reaction list.
    ///
    /// This property provides access to the current reactions, pagination information,
    /// and real-time updates. The state automatically updates when WebSocket events
    /// are received for reaction additions, updates, and deletions.
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// // Observe reaction changes
    /// reactionList.state.$reactions
    ///     .sink { reactions in
    ///         // Update UI with new reactions
    ///     }
    ///     .store(in: &cancellables)
    ///
    /// // Check if more reactions can be loaded
    /// if reactionList.state.canLoadMore {
    ///     // Load more reactions
    /// }
    /// ```

    /// Fetches the initial set of reactions for the comment.
    ///
    /// This method retrieves the first page of reactions based on the query configuration.
    /// The results are automatically stored in the state and can be accessed through
    /// the `state.reactions` property.
    ///
    /// - Returns: An array of `FeedsReactionData` representing the fetched reactions
    /// - Throws: `APIError` if the network request fails or the server returns an error
    ///
    /// ## Example
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// do {
    ///     let reactions = try await reactionList.get()
    ///     print("Fetched \(reactions.count) reactions")
    /// } catch {
    ///     print("Failed to fetch reactions: \(error)")

    ///
    /// This method fetches additional reactions using the pagination information
    /// from the previous request. If no more reactions are available, an empty
    /// array is returned.
    ///
    /// - Parameter limit: Optional limit for the number of reactions to fetch.
    ///   If not specified, uses the limit from the original query.
    /// - Returns: An array of `FeedsReactionData` representing the additional reactions.
    ///   Returns an empty array if no more reactions are available.
    /// - Throws: An error if the network request fails or the response cannot be parsed.
    ///
    /// ## Example
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// // Check if more reactions are available
    /// guard reactionList.state.canLoadMore else { return }
    ///
    /// // Load more reactions
    /// do {
