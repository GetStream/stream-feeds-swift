/// A list of activity reactions that provides pagination, filtering, and real-time updates.
///
/// This class manages a collection of reactions for a specific activity. It provides methods
/// to fetch reactions with pagination support and automatically handles real-time updates
/// when reactions are added or removed from the activity.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let query = ActivityReactionsQuery(activityId: "activity-123")
/// let reactionList = client.activityReactionList(for: query)
/// 
/// // Fetch initial reactions
/// let reactions = try await reactionList.get()
/// 
/// // Load more reactions if available
/// if reactionList.state.canLoadMore {
///     let moreReactions = try await reactionList.queryMoreReactions()
/// }
/// 
/// // Observe state changes
/// reactionList.state.$reactions
///     .sink { reactions in
///         print("Updated reactions: \(reactions.count)")
///     }
///     .store(in: &cancellables)
/// ```
///
/// ## Real-time Updates
///
/// The list automatically updates when reactions are added or removed from the activity
/// through WebSocket events. The state is observable and will notify subscribers of changes.
