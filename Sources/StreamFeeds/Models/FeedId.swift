/// A `FeedId` consists of two components:
/// - `group`: The feed group identifier (e.g., "user", "timeline", "notification")
/// - `id`: The specific feed identifier within that group
///
/// The complete feed identifier is represented as a colon-separated string: `"group:id"`
/// For example: `"user:john"`, `"timeline:flat"`, `"notification:aggregated"`
///
/// This type is thread-safe and can be used across different execution contexts.
